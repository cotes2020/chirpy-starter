# Chirpy Starter

A minimal, ready-to-use template for creating a blog with the [**Chirpy**][chirpy] Jekyll theme. Get up and running in minutes with all critical files pre-configured.

## Why This Starter Exists

When installing Chirpy through [RubyGems.org][gem], Jekyll can only read a subset of theme files (`_data`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`, `assets`) and limited `_config.yml` options from the gem. As a result, users cannot enjoy the full out-of-the-box experience that Chirpy offers.

To unlock all features, the following files must be present in your Jekyll site:

```shell
.
├── _config.yml
├── _plugins
├── _tabs
└── index.html
```

This starter bundles those files from the latest **Chirpy** release along with a [CD][CD] workflow, so you can start writing immediately.

## Usage
