## 📝 Challenge Write-up Guidelines

When documenting challenges, I follow these principles:

✅ **Do:**
- Document your learning process
- Explain your methodology
- Include helpful screenshots
- Note what you learned
- Discuss prevention/detection

❌ **Don't:**
- Share full solutions immediately after release
- Skip the learning explanation
- Only show commands without context
- Ignore the defensive perspective
