Last week I passed the CompTIA Network+ certification test! I'm still studying for the CCNA, but I wanted to get the Network+ so I can have a cert on my resume and apply for jobs in the meantime. 

Actually I think I'm going to start studying for the Security+ now. Once I get Security+ I will keep studying for the CCNA.

The Net+ was a good exam. The first 5 questions were performace based questions. They weren't too difficult but I felt flustered and spent a good deal of time working through the questions. After that I had to fly through the multiple choice questions in order to finish on time. Thankfully I passed!
