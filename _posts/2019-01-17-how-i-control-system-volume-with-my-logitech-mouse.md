It's so frustrating to keep adjusting volume everytime video you are watching is suddenly louder/quitter.

Even more, annoying if your keyboard doesn't have a dedicated volume button or you need to press both keys in order to adjust the volume. 

### My new solution:

So, I created a hotkey using the Right Mouse button and Scroll Wheel to control the volume. [__Learn more about it here__](https://github.com/AzimsTech/MyAhkList/blob/master/description/ClickScrollVolume.md)


![Repo](kohaT2o.png)

Download & run [**ClickScrollVolume.exe**](https://github.com/AzimsTech/MyAhkList/releases/tag/v1)  

#### How to run this script on boot
Move **ClickScrollVolume.exe** into this directory:

    C:\Users\(your username)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup


## It Works!

By doing this simple setup, now I can use my Right-click and Scroll Wheel anywhere to increase or decrease system volume. Nice!
