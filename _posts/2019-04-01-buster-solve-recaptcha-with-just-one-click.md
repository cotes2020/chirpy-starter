Websites have been using CAPTCHAs as a means to differentiate between actual users and bots since the early days of the Internet, but it can be really annoying when you need to do it every single time.

Today I found out that you can actually solve the [**reCAPTCHA**](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html) easily with  **Buster.**

Save Your Time With Buster
================================
Buster is a browser extension which can solve difficult captchas by using speech recognition. Captcha is solved by clicking on a button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget.
